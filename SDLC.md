# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Overview

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a standardized framework used to design, develop, test, and maintain software applications. It consists of a series of phases that provide structure and guidance throughout the development process. SDLC helps maximize efficiency, reduce costs, and meet customer needs effectively.

### Key Points:
- SDLC is a framework for software development.
- It consists of multiple phases like Planning, Requirements, Design, Build, Document, Test, Deploy, and Maintain.
- SDLC helps optimize development efficiency, reduce costs, and meet customer expectations.
- There are various SDLC models depending on the project’s scope.

## Importance of SDLC

The SDLC framework provides several benefits:

1. **Effective Planning**: Helps developers analyze requirements before development.
2. **Cost Reduction**: Estimates costs early, reducing unnecessary expenses during development.
3. **High-Quality Products**: Follows systematic processes, ensuring well-tested and high-quality software.
4. **Evaluation**: Provides a basis for evaluating software effectiveness and making improvements.

## Key Stages of SDLC

### 1. **Planning**

In the **Planning** phase, project leaders assess the project's scope and requirements. It includes cost estimations, defining timelines, and organizing teams.

- **Activities**:
  - Estimate labor and material costs.
  - Set goals and deadlines.
  - Create project teams and leadership structures.
  - Gather feedback from stakeholders (e.g., customers, developers).
  - Define the project scope and set boundaries.

**Example**: A social media app would gather feedback on its key features, such as a chat system, user profiles, and notifications.

---

### 2. **Define Requirements**

This phase involves determining what the application needs to do and its functional requirements.

- **Activities**:
  - Gather business requirements and user needs.
  - Define system requirements (e.g., hardware, software, and platforms).
  - Identify any external systems or integrations.

**Example**: For an inventory system, a requirement could be the ability to search and manage stock levels efficiently.

---

### 3. **Design and Prototyping**

The **Design** phase focuses on creating a model for the software application. It includes system architecture, user interface (UI) design, and defining communication and security protocols.

- **Key Aspects**:
  - **Architecture**: Choose programming languages, industry practices, and design templates.
  - **User Interface**: Design how users will interact with the application.
  - **Security**: Implement security measures like encryption and authentication.
  - **Prototyping**: Create a basic version of the application to gather feedback from stakeholders before the final development.

**Example**: In the design of a mobile app, the UI will define how users will navigate through screens, while security might include features like fingerprint authentication.

---

### 4. **Software Development**

The **Development** phase is where the actual coding takes place. Developers write the software based on the design specifications.

- **Activities**:
  - Coding the application using chosen technologies.
  - Implementing features as defined in the requirements.
  - Using version control systems like Git for source code management.

**Example**: Developers write the code to implement a user login system, integrating it with the database.

---

### 5. **Documentation**

Documentation is a crucial part of the SDLC. It includes formal and informal documents that explain how the software works and how to use it.

- **Types of Documentation**:
  - **User Guides**: Provide instructions on how to use the software.
  - **Technical Documentation**: Explains the software’s internal workings, including source code comments.
  - **Troubleshooting Guides**: Help users resolve common issues.

**Example**: For a new web application, a user manual may explain how to create an account, use features, and troubleshoot common issues.

---

### 6. **Testing**

**Testing** is the process of ensuring that the software works correctly and meets all requirements. It helps identify and fix bugs before the software is released to users.

- **Types of Testing**:
  - **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components or functions.
  - **Integration Testing**: Ensures that different parts of the application work together.
  - **Performance Testing**: Evaluates the application’s speed and responsiveness under different conditions.
  - **Security Testing**: Ensures that the application is secure from vulnerabilities.

**Example**: Before releasing a new version of a mobile app, it undergoes functional and performance testing to ensure it works properly on all supported devices.

---

### 7. **Deployment**

In the **Deployment** phase, the application is made available for use. This may include uploading the application to app stores or making it accessible through a website.

- **Activities**:
  - Ensure that the software is deployed to production environments.
  - Set up monitoring tools to track the app’s performance.
  - Automate deployment using Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) tools.

**Example**: After the testing phase, a web application is deployed to a server, and users can access it through a browser.

---

### 8. **Operations and Maintenance**

Once the application is live, it enters the **Maintenance** phase. This involves fixing bugs and updating the software as necessary.

- **Activities**:
  - Monitor the application for any issues reported by users.
  - Perform routine updates and enhancements.
  - Plan for future releases with new features.

**Example**: After deployment, users might report issues like slow performance, which would be fixed in an update.

---

## SDLC Models

There are different SDLC models depending on the scope and requirements of the project:

- **Waterfall Model**: A linear approach where each phase must be completed before the next starts.
- **Agile Model**: An iterative approach where development is done in small cycles (sprints), allowing for more flexibility and ongoing feedback.
- **Spiral Model**: Combines iterative development with systematic risk management.

---

## Conclusion

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is essential in delivering high-quality software in a structured and organized manner. It helps developers manage complex projects, minimize errors, and create software that meets customer needs.

# Scrum Ceremonies Overview

If you’re new to the Agile approach, or the Scrum methodology in particular, you might not know much about Scrum ceremonies. Here’s an overview of the four essential Scrum ceremonies and how they can help your product development team stay agile and efficient.

## What are the Four Scrum Ceremonies?

Scrum ceremonies—also known as Scrum events, Scrum meetings, or Agile ceremonies—are a key component of the Scrum process. The four Scrum ceremonies are:

1. Sprint Planning
2. Daily Stand-up
3. Sprint Review
4. Sprint Retrospective

### Timing of Scrum Ceremonies:
- **Sprint Planning** occurs before the sprint.
- **Daily Stand-up** meetings take place during the sprint.
- **Sprint Review** and **Sprint Retrospective** happen after the sprint has ended.

These four Scrum ceremonies form the backbone of the Scrum methodology. Proper planning, check-ins, and reflection empower teams to stay efficient, motivated, and mindful of their progress. Plus, reviewing each sprint’s challenges, accomplishments, and lessons helps make subsequent sprints more effective. 

Now, let’s take a closer look at each of the Scrum ceremonies.

---

## 1. Sprint Planning

If your team starts sprinting without proper planning, everyone will end up running in different directions. The first Scrum ceremony—**sprint planning**—creates a road map for the upcoming product development sprint.

- **Duration**: An hour or two should be enough for a one- or two-week sprint.
- **Participants**: Scrum Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master.

During the sprint planning session, the team consults the backlog, which is a list of all desired features and bug fixes that the team can select from to determine what to accomplish during the sprint.

### Activities:
- The team estimates how many items from the backlog they can complete with existing resources.
- The Scrum Master facilitates the meeting, the Product Owner clarifies the details and requirements, and the team members define the work and effort needed for each selected item.

A centralized work management platform can help organize the full backlog and individual sprint tasks.

---

## 2. Daily Stand-up (Daily Scrum)

**Stand-up meetings**—also called the **Daily Scrum**—ensure the sprint is proceeding effectively. These meetings are usually kept to no longer than 15 minutes.

- **Purpose**: To identify any roadblocks and ensure that team members are aligned with their current tasks, goals, and obstacles.
- **Participants**: Scrum Master, Product Owner, and the complete Scrum Team.
- **Frequency**: Daily.
- **Duration**: 15 minutes.

### Activities:
Each team member answers three key questions:
1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. Are there any blockers or obstacles?

The daily Scrum keeps each team member accountable and ensures that any issues are identified early. 

---

## 3. Sprint Review

After completing the sprint, it's time for the **Sprint Review** (also called an "iteration review") to meet with stakeholders and demonstrate what was accomplished during the sprint.

- **Participants**: Scrum Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner, other teams, managers, and executives.
- **Purpose**: To showcase the completed work and gather feedback.

### Activities:
- Celebrate the team's accomplishments.
- Solicit feedback from stakeholders to assess whether the product meets expectations.
- Address any revision requests or changes needed based on stakeholder input.

The sprint review helps teams assess their progress and gather valuable input that may shape future work.

---

## 4. Sprint Retrospective

The final Scrum ceremony is the **Sprint Retrospective**, where the development team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner meet to discuss the sprint’s successes, challenges, and insights.

- **Duration**: Typically lasts around one hour.
- **Purpose**: To reflect on the sprint and identify areas for improvement.

### Activities:
- Review feedback from stakeholders and the Scrum Master.
- Discuss what went well and what could be improved.
- Identify potential improvements for the next sprint, focusing on how to make processes more effective without assigning blame.

The retrospective fosters a culture of continuous improvement and ensures that the Scrum team is always adapting to become more efficient.

---

## How to Keep Your Scrum Ceremonies Effective

To ensure Scrum sprints and ceremonies are efficient:
- **Designate a Scrum Master**: The Scrum Master helps keep the team organized, facilitates meetings, and ensures the team stays on task.
- **Scrum Master's Role**: The Scrum Master acts as a servant-leader, guiding the team and helping them address obstacles without directly managing them.

Scrum Masters often rely on work management software to track progress, accountability, and questions to ensure the meetings are effective.

---

## Conclusion

Scrum ceremonies are a vital part of the Scrum process. While it might be tempting to skip them when your team is short on time, they are crucial for keeping teams productive, reflective, and continuously improving.

- 86% of respondents have initial planning sessions.
- 87% hold daily Scrum meetings.
- 81% take the time for a Scrum retrospective.

By taking the time to plan, reflect, and improve through Scrum ceremonies, teams ensure a cycle of continuous improvement and steady productivity.

# Agile Story Points Estimation

## Objective
After completing this module, associates should be able to:
- Define Story Pointing
- Explain how the Fibonacci Sequence is used to calculate story points.

## Agile Stories: A Refresher

Before we talk about story points in Agile, let’s remind ourselves what stories are in the Agile context.

A story is a simple, general explanation of a specific software feature. Stories are created from the customer or end-user’s perspective and show how the particular software feature will benefit the customer.

**Example Story:**  
“I manage a small accounting team at work, and I need a way for us to easily share spreadsheets in real-time while being able to communicate with each other simultaneously.”

## What are Story Points?

Story points (SP) are a type of comparative measurement unit. They are used by agile teams to provide estimates of the total amount of work required to completely implement items from the product backlog, or user stories. As a result, estimating story points actually entails estimating work and giving each backlog item a point value.

Put another way, it’s a numeric value that helps the development team understand the effort required to complete a story. The team assigns story points based on the work's complexity, amount, and uncertainty.

Story points in Agile are abstract measurements that developers use instead of hours. Points are relative values, so a story with a value of four is twice as hard as a story with a value of two. The actual numbers don’t matter — you could assign values between 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 if you want. Instead, you want to give the team an idea of the story’s relative difficulty. Story points tell you how much effort a given story will take to resolve.

### Story Points Vary Depending On:

#### The Team and Individual Member:
Story points are relative and depend on the team’s effectiveness. One person’s estimate may differ from another’s based on criteria like skill level, experience, and familiarity with specific tasks.

#### Another Value:
Because a story point is only meaningful in relation to another value, it is a relative unit. For example, if a task requires two narrative points to finish, it represents twice as much work as a task that just requires one story point.

### Fibonacci Sequence:
Instead of using linear scales like 1, 2, 3, you might use Fibonacci sequence values (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.). This allows for easier differentiation as tasks get larger, where the effort required increases non-linearly.

## What is a Burndown Chart?

A burndown chart is a visual representation of the amount of work completed versus the amount of work remaining in a project or sprint. The chart is updated frequently and is visible to all team members to monitor progress.

### Types of Burndown Charts:
1. **Sprint Burndown:** Tracks work left in a sprint.
2. **Product Burndown:** Tracks work left in the overall product plan.

## What is Fibonacci Agile Estimation?

Agile estimation refers to quantifying the effort needed to complete a task. Fibonacci sequence is one method used for estimating agile story points. It follows the sequence:  
`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`

### Why Use the Fibonacci Sequence?
Using Fibonacci helps deal with increasing complexity and uncertainty in large tasks. The increasing gap between the numbers makes it easier for teams to estimate larger tasks without getting bogged down in small variations.

### How Does Fibonacci Agile Estimation Work in Practice?
When using the Fibonacci sequence, higher numbers (e.g., 34, 55, 89) reflect larger efforts with more uncertainty. This helps the team agree on estimates for tasks without getting bogged down by small increments. 

## Why Should Teams Use Story Points in Agile?

Story points offer several benefits for both development teams and product owners.

### Benefits for Development Teams:
- **Clearer understanding of work:** Easier to devise implementation strategies.
- **Better sprint planning:** Helps teams know how much work to plan in a sprint.
- **Sustainable pace:** Teams can work at a reasonable pace without over-planning.

### Benefits for Product Owners:
- **Better ROI assessment:** Helps assess the return on investment for each feature.
- **Understanding of risks:** Provides insights into technical risks of larger items.
- **Better forecasting:** Helps predict longer-term delivery of the product.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Don’t assign story points to small tasks that can be estimated timewise.
- Story point estimation is a team effort — ensure everyone contributes.
- Don’t average story points.
- Don’t let one variable influence the process — story points consider all aspects of a task, including complexity, uncertainty, and risks.

## Who Uses a Burndown Chart?

Burndown charts are mainly used by:
- **Team Managers:** To monitor overall project progress.
- **Developers:** To track specific tasks and see what’s left in an Agile sprint.

### Components of a Burndown Chart:
- **Axes:**
  - X-axis: Tracks time until project deadline.
  - Y-axis: Tracks the amount of work remaining (number of tickets, tasks, etc.).
  
- **Ideal Work Remaining Line:** Represents the ideal progress line showing how much work should have been completed.
  
- **Actual Work Remaining Line:** Shows the real progress made, based on completed tasks.

## Estimating with Story Points

### How are Story Points Calculated?
Story points are typically calculated by comparing tasks to a prior, similar project. The team estimates the relative complexity of the task based on this comparison.

### What if it’s the Team’s First Time Estimating?
If it’s the team’s first time estimating, they must choose a baseline task that they can all relate to. From there, they compare other tasks to the baseline to estimate the story points.

### Story Points Sizing

The story points sizing should increase as tasks grow larger. The Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.) provides a non-linear scale to reflect the increasing uncertainty and complexity of larger tasks.

### Fibonacci vs Linear Sequence:
- **Fibonacci Sequence:**
  - Non-linear scale, better reflecting task uncertainty.
  - Ideal for tasks that vary in complexity and size.
  
- **Linear Sequence:**
  - Simpler and easier to use.
  - Assumes a linear relationship between task size and effort.

### Considerations:
- **Uncertainty:** Fibonacci handles larger uncertainties better than linear sequences.
- **Ease of Use:** Linear sequences are simpler but less flexible.
- **Psychological Factors:** Fibonacci encourages teams to think in general categories, while linear sequences may focus too much on precision.

## Conclusion

The choice between using Fibonacci or a linear sequence depends on the team's preference and the nature of the tasks. Using story points and burndown charts effectively can help agile teams plan sprints, track progress, and deliver software efficiently.

# Waterfall Development Cycle

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, associates should be able to:

- Define the Waterfall development cycle.
- Elaborate on the steps in the Waterfall cycle.
- Explain how the Waterfall cycle is used in developing software.

## Waterfall SDLC Model

The **Waterfall** model is the traditional and classic approach to software development. As each phase is completed, the project flows into the next phase, resembling the cascading nature of a waterfall. This model follows a **linear** and **sequential** flow, where each step must be fully completed before moving on to the next. While it has been a tried-and-tested methodology in the past, its suitability for modern complex projects is debated.

### Phases of the Waterfall Model

The phases in the Waterfall SDLC model are typically as follows:

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**:
   - In this initial phase, the requirements for the software are gathered from all stakeholders.
   - This phase aims to clearly define the features and functions of the software.
   
2. **System Design**:
   - Based on the gathered requirements, a system design is created.
   - This design phase outlines the architecture, software components, and their interactions.

3. **Implementation (Coding)**:
   - The actual code is written during this phase.
   - Developers implement the design specifications from the previous phase.
   
4. **Integration and Testing (Verification)**:
   - After the software is developed, it undergoes thorough testing to ensure it meets the requirements.
   - This is where any bugs or issues are identified and resolved.
   
5. **Deployment (Maintenance)**:
   - Once the software passes testing, it is deployed to the production environment.
   - After deployment, it enters the maintenance phase, where updates, patches, or bug fixes may be needed.

## Advantages of the Waterfall Model

- **Simplicity**: The Waterfall model is easy to understand and implement, making it a good choice for smaller projects.
- **Clear Phases**: The phases are clearly defined, making it easier for project managers and developers to track progress.
- **Well-suited for Short Projects**: Works efficiently for projects with well-understood requirements and smaller scope.
  
## Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model

- **Not Ideal for Complex Projects**: It struggles with larger and more complex software projects due to the rigidity of its linear process.
- **Time-consuming**: Since each phase must be completed before the next one can begin, the model can be slow and inefficient.
- **Delayed Testing**: Testing only begins after the development phase, which means that issues or defects might not be identified until later in the process, leading to higher technical debt.
  
## Conclusion

The Waterfall model is a traditional software development lifecycle (SDLC) model that has been widely used. However, due to its linear nature, it can be inefficient for large-scale or complex projects. Despite its limitations, it remains useful for small projects or scenarios where requirements are clear from the beginning.
# Waterfall Development Cycle

## Examples of the Waterfall Model

In the past, the **Waterfall model** was the default approach for developing large-scale enterprise applications, including:

- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** systems
- **Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS)**
- **Supply Chain Management Systems**
- **Inventory Management Systems**
- **Point of Sales (POS) systems** for retail chains

These enterprise systems were typically developed over a period of **two to three years**, with the Waterfall model as the default approach. However, as technology evolved, the pace of change in these systems often rendered them outdated by the time they were completed.

Despite the transition to more flexible and cost-effective models in many sectors, the Waterfall model remains preferred in certain cases, particularly when:

1. **Human Life is at Risk**: In critical systems where a failure could result in fatalities, such as medical, military, and aerospace applications.
2. **Safety and Stability are Priorities**: Where factors like money and time are secondary, and the focus is on the stability and safety of the project.
3. **Strict and Constant Requirements**: Military and aircraft programs where requirements are well-defined from the beginning and remain consistent throughout.
4. **High Accountability and Oversight**: Projects with stringent oversight, like those in **banking**, **healthcare**, and **nuclear control systems**, where compliance and safety are paramount.

## Phases of the Waterfall Model

The original **Waterfall method** included the following major steps:

1. **Requirements Determination**
2. **Design**
3. **Implementation**
4. **Verification**
5. **Maintenance**

However, over time, several models have emerged that either modify or break these steps down into further sub-phases. For instance, some models separate the **Requirements phase** into **Planning** and **Analysis**, or break down the **Design phase** into **Logical** and **Physical Design** sub-phases. Despite these variations, the fundamental principles of the Waterfall model remain the same.

### Elaboration on Waterfall Model Phases

#### 1. **Requirements Determination**
   - The Waterfall method assumes that **all requirements** can be gathered up front in the **Requirements** phase.
   - During this phase, there is extensive **communication with users** to ensure a clear understanding of their needs.
   - This phase is critical for setting expectations and capturing all the project’s details before proceeding to the next stage.

#### 2. **Design**
   - The **Design** phase can be broken into:
     - **Logical Design**: The system is designed based on the requirements but is independent of hardware or software systems.
     - **Physical Design**: Once the **Logical Design** is complete, it is translated into a **Physical Design**, which specifies the actual hardware and software specifications.
   
#### 3. **Implementation (Coding)**
   - During the **Implementation** phase, the actual **code** for the application is written.
   - **Programmers** take the requirements and designs and develop the system.

#### 4. **Verification (Testing)**
   - The **Verification** phase ensures the proj
# Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, associates should be able to:

- Compare and contrast the Agile methodology versus the Waterfall methodology.

## Overview

Agile and Waterfall are two widely used methodologies for managing software development projects. While both aim to complete projects successfully, they approach the process in very different ways.

### Agile Methodology

**Agile** is an iterative methodology that promotes a **cyclic** and **collaborative** process. The project is broken into multiple iterations (or sprints), where the team works on a set of tasks within a defined period. The main steps in Agile include:

1. **Development Phase**: Tasks are worked on iteratively.
2. **Review & Feedback**: After each iteration, the work is reviewed, feedback is gathered, and adjustments are made.
3. **Approval or Rework**: Based on the feedback, the work is either approved for implementation or requires adjustments.
4. **Implement & Complete**: The tasks are implemented, and the process repeats for the next set of tasks.

Agile is dynamic and highly flexible, with a focus on continuous improvement, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive planning.

### Waterfall Methodology

**Waterfall** is a sequential methodology where tasks follow a defined, linear process. The steps move in one direction like a waterfall, and each phase is completed before moving on to the next. The typical Waterfall steps include:

1. **Defining Requirements**: Clearly documenting the project requirements.
2. **Designing the Implementation**: Planning the design before development begins.
3. **Implementation**: Coding the application or feature based on the design.
4. **Verification & Quality Assurance**: Testing the work to ensure it meets the requirements.
5. **Maintenance**: Maintaining and supporting the feature once it's deployed.

Waterfall works well when the requirements are well-defined upfront, and there is little need for change during the project lifecycle.

## Comparison of Agile vs. Waterfall

### Agile Methodology

#### Advantages:
- **Faster Feedback Cycles**: Frequent reviews and feedback result in faster identification of problems.
- **Identifies Problems Early**: Since work is reviewed iteratively, issues are spotted and fixed early in the process.
- **Higher Potential for Customer Satisfaction**: Agile ensures continuous engagement with customers and stakeholders.
- **Improved Time to Market**: With regular releases, the product or feature can be delivered faster.
- **Better Visibility & Accountability**: Agile promotes transparency within teams and stakeholders.
- **Dedicated Teams Drive Better Productivity**: Agile promotes cross-functional teams who work together efficiently.
- **Flexible Prioritization Focused on Value Delivery**: Teams can adjust priorities based on real-time feedback and evolving business needs.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Critical Path and Inter-Project Dependencies**: Agile may struggle to clearly define critical paths and dependencies across projects.
- **Organizational Learning Curve**: Adopting Agile may require significant time to train teams and adjust the organization’s workflow.
- **Technical Dependencies**: Implementing true Agile practices requires a well-established continuous deployment pipeline, which can be costly and technically challenging.

### Waterfall Methodology

#### Advantages:
- **Less Coordination Needed**: The clear and defined phases require less coordination between teams.
- **Clear Project Phases**: Each phase has distinct deliverables, making it easier to track progress and dependencies.
- **Predictable Cost**: The cost of the project can be estimated early once the requirements are defined.
- **Better Documentation**: There’s a stronger focus on documenting designs, requirements, and processes.
- **Structured Design**: The design phase is detailed and methodical before any development begins.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Hard to Share Work**: Since the phases are strictly defined, teams often need to be specialized and find it difficult to collaborate across phases.
- **Risk of Time Waste**: Delays or setbacks in one phase can cause significant time waste due to the rigid, sequential flow.
- **Specialized Teams Needed**: Waterfall often requires specialized teams for each phase, whereas Agile encourages a cross-functional approach.
- **Communication Overhead**: The handoff between phases often adds extra communication complexity and overhead.
- **Limited Product Engagement**: Stakeholder engagement may not be as frequent as in Agile, reducing the visibility and involvement in ongoing development.

## Real-World Application

### When to Use Agile:
- Projects with **evolving requirements** or **frequent changes**.
- Environments where **quick delivery** and **frequent feedback** are essential.
- Customer engagement and **stakeholder satisfaction** are top priorities.
- Teams that thrive in **collaborative, flexible** environments.

### When to Use Waterfall:
- Projects with **well-defined, unchanging requirements**.
- When the **project scope** and **timeline** are fixed.
- In regulated environments where **documentation** and **processes** are essential.
- Projects that require a **high degree of oversight**, such as those in **aerospace** or **healthcare**.

## Conclusion

The choice between Agile and Waterfall depends on the **nature** of the project, the **timeline**, and how **flexible** the requirements are. **Agile** is well-suited for dynamic, iterative projects with constant feedback, while **Waterfall** is ideal for projects with clear and stable requirements that can be completed in a linear sequence.
